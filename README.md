The aim of this project is to create a job scheduler for distributed systems that will automatically start jobs for a discrete event simulator (ds-sim). This simulator uses a server-client model with the server already being provided, therefore, only the client needs to be configured. \
\
The project is divided into two stages:
- Stage 1 - Design and implement a vanilla client-side simulator that contains basic scheduling functions and a simple job dispatcher. A demo of the client connecting to the server will be included as well as a five page report documenting:
  - System Overview
  - Design
  - Implementation
- Stage 2 - Design and implement new scheduling algorithms that will be compared to other algorithms such as First-Fit (FF), Best-Fit (BF), Worst-Fit (WF), and First-Capable (FC). This new scheduling algorithm aims to optimise the average turnaround time whilst not sacrificing the performance of any other metrics (i.e., average waiting time, total cost, etc). Another five page report will be included in this stage documenting:
  -  Problem Definition
  -  Algorithm Description
  -  Implementation
  -  Evaluation
