The aim of this project is to create a job scheduler for distributed systems that will automatically start jobs for a discrete event simulator (ds-sim). This simulator uses a server-client model with the server already being provided, therefore, only the client needs to be configured. \
\
The project is divided into two stages:
- Stage 1 - Design and implement a vanilla client-side simulator that contains basic scheduling functions and a simple job dispatcher. A demo of the client connecting to the server will be included as well as a five page report documenting:
  - System Overview
  - Design
  - Implementation
- Stage 2 - Design and implement new scheduling algorithms that will be compared to other algorithms such as First-Fit (FF), Best-Fit (BF) and Worst-Fit (WF).
