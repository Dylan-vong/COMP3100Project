The aim of this project is to create a job scheduler for distributed systems that will automatically start jobs for a discrete event simulator (ds-sim). \
This simulator uses a server-client model with the server already being provided, therefore, only the client needs to be configured. \
The project is divided into two stages: \
  Stage 1 - Design and implement a vanilla client-side simulator that contains basic scheduling functions and a simple job dispatcher. A five page report will also be  included and a demo of the client connecting to the server. \
  Stage 2 - Design and implement new scheduling algorithms that will be compared to other algorithms such as First-Fit (FF), Best-Fit (BF) and Worst-Fit (WF).
